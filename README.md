Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## Overview/Purpose of the project
The overall purpose of this project was to analyze trends of kickstarter success and failure from 2012 to 2017 in the "Theater" category and "Plays" subcategory. Likely factors such as launch date of Theater Kickstarters and subsequently goals set for the "Plays" were examined in order to accomplish this.   


###### The smallest heading



### ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png)
### [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs)

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.
Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.
Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).
Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).
Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
