Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## Overview/Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to examine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals after Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.  

### Analysis and Challenges
In order to provide Louise a measured explanation, an analysis of Theatre kickstarter trends from 2012 to 2017 was conducgted. Specific factors such as launch date of Theater Kickstarters and the funding goals set for the "Plays" were examined in order to measure their impact on success and failure outcomes. Although there were no challenges that needed to be overcome when performing this analysis, one could easily make a mistake by not taking a step back and remembering why the anlaysis is being conducted in the first place. While it's great to have a micro level view of data to prevent mistakes in calculations, it's very important to remember the overall goal.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Since Launch date may have been a critical factor in determining success or failure for Theatre Kickstarters, an analysis was conducted on outcomes based on Launch Date. Moreover, using data from 2012 to 2017, the grand total for success, failure, and cancelations was calculated for each month in order to determine which month was more favorable for launching Theater Kickstarters and vice versa. As seen in the below line chart, the month of May had the highest amounth of successful Theatre Kickstarer Launches (111) when compared to the other months. However, May also accounted for the most amount of failures (54).   


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset? recency, musical and spaces subcategory comparison, percentages

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? percentages, comparison of Plays to other subcategories.

### ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png)
### [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs)

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.
Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.
Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).
Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).
Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
